## Description

This is a simple to-do-list.
This project has been written as a training task within JS course to become familiar with objects and arrays in functions.
This aplication adds tasks to the list.
By "Dodaj zadanie" button a task can be added to the list. By green button a task can be "ticked" and crossed out, and by red button a task can be removed.
"Ukryj / Pokaż ukończone" button changes depend on the tasks are done or not. "Ukryj ukończone" button makes tasks to be hidden, and on the reverse - "Pokaż ukończone" button shows the tasks which have been done.
By "Ukończ wszystkie" button all of the tasks can be marked as done, and then this button becomes to be disabled.
